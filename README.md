# Introduction

Naetorp is a platform for sharing narrow scoped best practice articles \(Micropractices\). These micropractices have a 5000 character limit to dissuade users from writing beyond a single idea, and they include first class support for updates with required versioning. Naetorp also supports a perspective system - analogous to the issues section of many online git repository platforms - which allows users to expand on the initial ideas of the micropractice. Finally, underpinning the entire Naetorp platform is a points and rank system designed to encourage original contributions and collaboration.

### Getting Started

The fastest way to get started is to starting searching for micropractices by title, pitches, and tags. To enable the interactive components of Naetorp like starring micropractices, adding perspectives, and creating original micropractices, you can signup with a public username, email, and password.

### Why does Naetorp exist?

There are so many amazing resources in the programming community for learning and mastering various languages, libraries, and technologies. From Stack Overflow's simple question and answer format, to Eggheads' video tutorials, and Jsfiddles' demoing capabilities, each tool provides a unique solution to a specific area in the programming ecosystem. Best practices are one such area that is still served entirely through books, blogs, and anecdotal conversations, and while these resources are effective, there are serious limitations.

The most glaring issue is the one that surrounds new technologies. Blogs and books are excellent resources for stable technologies, but problematic for dynamic technologies where best practices change every few weeks or months. Blogs can be updated, but the majority are more ephemeral in nature, like a snapshot of a best practice at a specific time, and made for immediate consumption. Books go through longer publication cycles, and newer technologies don't necessarily attract the best writers right away.

There's also no central location for best practices. You might find a best practice on a personal blog, a medium article, or in the recipes section of a library's documentation, which means finding a best practice is harder than it needs to be.

### Who is Naetorp for?

Neatorp serves two different interest groups, although they are by no means exclusive. The first group are the people looking for new ideas on how to use a certain technology. This includes both tyros just starting out, and virtuosos working to solidify their proficiency. The second group are the experts in new technologies who know best practices, but don't have the time or content for a full book, and who feel that a blog post is an insufficient return on information shared. Naetorp is easy to contribute to as every article is limited in length, and with versioning articles are made to last the tests of time, so their significance stretches beyond immediate consumption.
