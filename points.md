### Introduction

Naetorp employs 

\*

Why points?

\*

gamify

\*

encourage positive collaboration and contributions

\*

A good quantification for assessing perspectives and practices

\*

How it works?

\*

points for every time your practice is starred

\*

points for successful cocontributions

\*

in the future, smaller actions will also result in points

\*

Points and tags

\*

all points are created with reference to a tag

\*

a tag is the scope of a practice. For example, a practice about reactjs components would have a reactjs tag, and a practice about a popular library within the reactjs ecosystem would have a reactjs tag and a library tag

\*

Any points awarded are always based off of the tags of the parent practice

\*

Total points for an action are divided by the number of tags in scope, so if an action is normally worth 1 point, if it has 2 tags, then each tag gets 0.5 points

\*

How ranks work?

\*

ranks are the percentile calculation of a users total points per tag

\*

only the top 75% ranks are shown. The bottom 25% simply remain unranked

\*

calculated daily

\*

ranks must have a minimum of 25 users with points in that tag to display

\*

Current scoring

\*

Starring a practice: 1 point

\*

Cocontribution:

\*

initial points:

\*

major: 1 point

\*

minor: 0.5 points

\*

patch: 0.1 points

\*

subsequent stars

\*

Sum\(initial points\)

\*

Ie. if a user adds 2 major contributions, and 1 minor contribution, each successive occasion a new user stars the practice results in the cocontributor receiving 2.5 points
